A positive result from the TCC requires that we have a subset of our cover to serve as the boundary.
That is, the the condition not only checks that we have coverage, but also that we have a pair of spaces that reflects the pair $(D, B)$ in homology.
We call such a pair a \emph{surrounding pair} defined in terms of separating sets.
It has been shown that the TCC can be stated in terms of these surrounding pairs and that assumptions can be made directly in terms of their persistent homology~\cite{cavanna2017when}.
This allows allows us enough flexibility to define our surrounding set as a sublevel of a $c$-Lipschitz function $f$ and state our assumptions in terms of its persistent homology.
