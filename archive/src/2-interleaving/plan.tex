Because the TCC only confirms coverage of a \emph{superlevel} set $D\setminus B_\omega$, we cannot guarantee coverage of the entire domain.
Indeed, with sufficient smoothness assumptions on the boundary we could compute the persistent homology of the \emph{restriction} of $f$ to the superlevel set we cover in the standard way~\cite{chazal09analysis}.
Instead, we will approximate the persistent homology of the sublevel set filtration \emph{relative to} the sublevel set $B_\omega$.
In the next section we will discuss an interpretation of the relative diagram that is motivated by examples in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}.

We will first introduce the notion of an extension which will provide us with maps on relative homology induced by inclusion via excision.
However, even then, a map that factors through the pair $(D, B_\omega)$ is not enough to prove an interleaving of persistence modules by inclusion directly.
To address this we will impose conditions on sublevel sets near $B_\omega$ which generalize the assumptions made in the TCC.
