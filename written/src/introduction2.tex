Topology is the mathematical study of shape.
Often referred to as ``rubber sheet geometry,'' topology is concerned with the properties of a space that are invariant under continuous deformations.
Connected components, loops, and voids are examples of topological invariants that correspond to ``holes'' in dimensions 0, 1, and 2.
These invariants can be computed using a tool from algebraic topology known as \emph{homology}.
Homology not only quantifies these holes but also associates an algebraic structure to the space in each dimension.
Given a scalar valued function on the spae persistent homology uses this structure to decompose its homology in a way that provides useful geometric and topological information about both the function and the space itself.

Persistent homology is a central tool in the emerging field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) which is concerned with the ``shape of data.''
TDA has found a number of applications in\ldots
The appeal of topological methods in data analysis is primarily due to their ability to identify meaningful global structure from local data in high dimensions.
Often this analysis involves approximating the persistent homology of a scalar valued function on some unknown domain from a set of sample points.
We refer to this approximation as Topological Scalar Field Analysis (SFA).
A fundamental assumption required for strong guarantees is that the sample covers the domain of the function at a certain scale.
% A fundamental assumption of this Topological Scalar Field Analysis (SFA) is that the sample sufficiently covers the domain of the function.
The Topological Coverage Criterion (TCC) is a computable condition for coverage that uses the same homological and combinatorial tools required for SFA.
We therefore present the TCC as a way to verify that a given sample is sufficient for SFA.
Moreover, this reinterpretation allows us to extend SFA to the case of partial coverage.

% This qualatative and quantitative information can provide insight on the structure of high dimensional data.
% A key component of TDA is the analysis of scalar fields by persistent homology.

% {\color{red} The persistent homology of a scalar valued function provides a signature for the structure of the domain that maps to increasing sublevel sets. \textbf{why is this useful.}}
% Given a collection of points that sample the function, one can approximate this signature with some guarantees.
% Key to this is the requirement that the sample covers the domain of the function geometrically.
% The topological coverage criterion uses these same homological and combinatorial tools to do just this---provide a computatible condition for coverage requiring only pairwise connectivity information.
% Unlike previous work that requires the sample points can ``detect'' the presence of the true topological boundary we re-cast the TCC in a way that embraces the sample as that of a function.
% That is, we will use the function values to identify a boundary as a sublevel set of the function, resolving one of the major barriers to wider use.
% Moreover, this allows us to extend topological scalar field analysis to instances with partial coverage.

% The topological coverage criterion (TCC) can be used to test whether an underlying space is sufficiently well covered by a given data set.
% Given a sufficiently dense sample, topological scalar field analysis (SFA) can give a summary of the shape of a real-valued function on its domain.
% The calculation and use of this summary is the subject of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) which is concerned with the ``shape'' of data.
% The goal of this paper is to adapt the TCC so that one can test for coverage while computing a summary with SFA.
% This provides a pipeline for verified scalar field analysis that simultaneously computes a topological signature of a function while testing that the underlying space is sufficiently well-sampled.

% We will give a computable condition that ensures a set of sample points can be used to analyze the structure of a scalar field.
% In other words, a way to verify that a given sample can provide a signature that captures both qualitative and quantitative shape information from a set of points endowed with a metric and a real-valued function.
% % The only requirement is that these points are endowed with limited pairwise connectivity information.
% In comparison to previous work our approach embraces the sample as that of a scalar-valued function, resolving one of the major barriers to wider use.

\paragraph{Related Work}

Initiated by De Silva and Ghrist~\cite{desilva06coordinate,desilva07coverage,desilva07homological}, the theory of homological sensor networks addresses the problem of testing coverage of a bounded domain by a collection of sensors without coordinates.
The main result is the topological coverage criterion, which, in its most general form, states that under reasonable geometric assumptions, the $d$-dimensional relative homology of a pair of simplicial complexes built on the neighborhood graph will be nontrivial if and only if there is sufficient coverage (see Section~\ref{sec:tcc} for the precise statements).
This relative persistent homology test is called the Topological Coverage Criterion (TCC).
Prior work on SFA by Chazal et al.~\cite{chazal09analysis} showed that for sufficiently dense samples on sufficiently smooth spaces, the persistence diagram can be computed with some guarantees.
In followup work, Buchet et al.~\cite{buchet15topological} extended this result to show how to work with noisy inputs.

Superficially, the methods of SFA and TCC are very similar.
Both construct similar complexes and compute the persistent homology of the homological image of a complex on one scale into that of a larger scale.
They even overlap on some common techniques in their analysis such as the use of the Nerve theorem and the Rips-\v{C}ech interleaving.
However, they differ in some fundamental ways that make them difficult to combine as a single technique.
The main difference is that the TCC requires a clearly defined boundary.
Not only must the underlying space be a bounded subset of $\R^d$, the data must also be labeled to indicate which input points are close to the boundary.
This requirement is perhaps the main reason why the TCC can so rarely be applied in practice.
% Cavanna et al.~\cite{cavanna2017when} generalized the TCC to allow for more general spaces and robust coverage guarantees.
% That work gave a different approach to proving the correctness of the TCC which allows much more freedom in how the boundary is defined.

In applications to data analysis it is more natural to assume that the data measures some unknown function.
% By requiring that our function is related to the metric of the space
We can then replace this requirement with assumptions about the function itself.
Indeed, these assumptions could relate the behavior of the function to the topological boundary of the space.
However, the generalized approach by Cavanna et al.~\cite{cavanna2017when} allows much more freedom in how the boundary is defined.

We consider the case in which we have incomplete data from a particular sublevel set of our function.
% We consider the case where we can only verify our sample in a part of the  % have incomplete data from a particular sublevel set of our function.
Our goal is to isolate this data so we can analyze the function in only the verified region.
%corresponding part persistent homology of the function in the verified region without allowing missing
From this perspective, the TCC confirms that we not only have coverage, but that the sample we have is topologically representative of the region near, and above this sublevel set.
We can then re-use the same machinery to analyze a \emph{part} of the function in a specific way.
