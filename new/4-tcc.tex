% Let $\D\subset\R^d$ and $f:\D\to\R$ be a $c$-Lipschitz function satisfying the following assumptions for some $\omega\in\R$, $\delta > 0$ and $\gamma > 3\delta$.
Let $\D\subset \R^d$ be a compact subset of $\R^d$ and $f:\D\to\R$ be a $c$-Lipschitz function on $\D$.
The requirement that $\D$ is a strict subset is in order to ensure that any set $B$ surrounding $\D$ separates $\R^d$ with \emph{non-empty} parts $(\D\setminus B, \R^d\setminus\D)$.
In the case of $\D = \R^d$ we can instead view $\D$ as a proper subset of the sphere $S^d\cong \R^d\cup\{\infty\}$.
Let $P\subset \D$ be a finite collection of points which will serve as the (unknown) locations of sensors with the following capabilities.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[a.]\textbf{(Communication Radii)} detect the presence, but not location or distance, of sensors within distances $\delta > 0$ and $\gamma \geq 3\delta$, and discriminate between sensors within each scale,
        % \item[b.]\textbf{(Coverage Radius)} cover a radially symmetric subset of the domain with radius $\delta$,
        \item[c.]\textbf{(Measurement)} measure the scalar value $f(p)$.

The original TCC~\cite{desilva07coverage} and work on scalar fields~\cite{chazal09analysis} make strict assumptions about the geometry of the domain $\D$ and its boundary $\B$.
We re-interpreted the TCC by replacing the assumptions about the geometry of the domain with assumptions about its persistent homology~\cite{cavanna2017when}.
This amounted to a requirement that the zero-dimensional homology of the domain did not change as we shrunk the domain within a certain range.

In this work we would like to extend this idea from the zero-dimensional homology of a geometric domain to the homology of all dimensions of a domain defined as a sublevel-set of a function.
We can then re-interpret the geometric assumptions made in the work on scalar fields in a similar way which re-purposes the machinery used to confirm coverage.

Throughout, let $D_a = f^{-1}[a, \infty)$ and $B_a = f^{-1}(-\infty, a]$  denote the superlevel and sublevel sets of $f$.
We will make the following assumptions about the sublevel-sets of $f$ with respect to a constant $\omega\in\R$ and $\gamma\geq \delta > 0$.

In the following we restrict $P$ to $D_{\omega-2c\delta}$, let $Q = P\cap B_{\omega - c\delta}$, and $\B = B_0^{\gamma-\delta}\cap\D$.

% Assumption 1 replaces the requirement that $\B$ is the topological boundary of the domain $\D$.
% As we did in previous work the notion of a topological boundary is replaced with that of a subset which surrounds the domain.
% In addition to this we define this surrounding subset in terms of a scalar value $\omega$ which gives us a sublevel set that will serve as our boundary $\B$.
% In doing so we can state the following assumptions in terms of the persistent homology of the function itself instead of the persistent homology of a geometric domain.
%
% Assumption 2 is our main restriction on the persistent homology of the surrounding sub-level set and limits the size of features in terms of the offset parameters $\delta,\gamma$.
% We note that this assumption is stronger than those made in our initial work which only required that the map $\hom_0(\D\setminus\D_{\omega+2c\delta}\hookrightarrow\D\setminus\B^{2\delta})$ be surjective which is not sufficient for the analysis of scalar fields.
%
% Assumption 3 requires that the region containing the sampled boundary $Q^\delta$ resembles the extended boundary $\B^{2\delta}$.
% While this assumption would not be necessary if $Q$ was defined as the set of points within distance $\delta$ of $\B$ we are particularily interested in the case in which the points cannot detect any features of the domain, such as the presence of a boundary, and can only measure some scalar value.
%
% Finally, assumption 4 is our only additional restriction on the choice of the parameter $\gamma\geq 3\delta$ so that it does not extend beyond the sub-level set $\D_{\omega+2c\delta}$.
