Let $X$ be a topological space and $(D,B)$ a pair in $X$.
The set $B$ \textbf{surrounds $D$ in $X$} if $B$ separates $X$ with the pair $(D\setminus B, X\setminus D)$.
We will refer to such a pair as a \textbf{surrounding pair in $X$}.

Unlike the definition of a separating set, which simply breaks a space into disjoint subsets, we make the distinction between interior and exterior explicit by defining the subset $B$ relative $D$.
That is, the set $D\setminus B$ corresponds to the interior of $D$ and $X\setminus D$ corresponds to the complement of $D$ in $X$.
$B$ then serves as a boundary in the sense that there is no path from the ``interior'' to the ``complement,'' which is sufficient for a homological coverage criterion.

Let $(D, B)$ be a surrounding pair in $X$ and $U\subseteq D$, $V\subseteq U\cap B$ be subsets.
Let $\ell: \hom_0(X\setminus B, X\setminus D)\to \hom_0(X\setminus V, X\setminus U)$ be induced by inclusion.
The following lemmas are generalize the proof of the TCC as properties of surrounding sets.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:coverage}
  If $\ell$ is injective then $D\setminus B\subseteq U$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  (See Appendix~\ref{apx:omit})
\end{proof}
\proofatend
    Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $p$ is injective and there exists a point $x\in (D\setminus B)\setminus U$.
    Because $B$ surrounds $D$ in $X$ the pair $(D\setminus B, \overline{D})$ forms a separation of $\overline{B}$.
    Therefore, $\hom_0(\overline{B})\cong \hom_0(D\setminus B)\oplus \hom_0(\overline{D})$ so
    \[ \hom_0(\overline{B}, \overline{D})\cong \hom_0(D\setminus B). \]
    So $[x]$ is non-trivial in $\hom_0(\overline{B},\overline{D})\cong \hom_0(D\setminus B)$ as $x$ is in some connected component of $D\setminus B$.
    So we have the following sequence of maps induced by inclusions
    \[ \hom_0(\overline{B},\overline{D})\xrightarrow{f} \hom_0(\overline{B},\overline{D}\cup\{x\})\xrightarrow{g} \hom_0(\overline{V},\overline{U}).\]
    As $f[x]$ is trivial in $\hom_0(\overline{B},\overline{D}\cup\{x\})$ we have that $\ell[x] = (g\circ f)[x]$ is trivial, contradicting our hypothesis that $\ell$ is injective.
\endproofatend

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:cov_surrounds}
  If $\ell$ injective then $V$ surrounds $U$ in $D$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  (See Appendix~\ref{apx:omit})
\end{proof}
\proofatend
  Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $V$ does not surround $U$ in $D$.
  Then there exists a path $\gamma : [0,1]\to\overline{V}$ with $\gamma(0)\in U\setminus V$ and $\gamma(1)\in D\setminus U$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:coverage} we know that $D\setminus B\subseteq U$, so $D\setminus B\subseteq U\setminus V$.

  Choose $x\in D\setminus B$ and $z\in \overline{D}$ such that there exist paths $\xi : [0,1]\to U\setminus V$ with $\xi(0) = x$, $\xi(1) = \gamma(0)$ and $\zeta : [0,1]\to \overline{D}\cup (D\setminus U)$ with $\zeta(0) = z$, $\zeta(1) = \gamma(1)$.
  $\xi, \gamma$ and $\zeta$ all generate chains in $C_1(\overline{V}, \overline{U})$ and $\xi + \gamma + \zeta = \gamma^*\in C_1(\overline{V}, \overline{U})$ with $\partial\gamma^* = x + z$.
  Moreover, $z$ generates a chain in $C_0(\overline{U})$ as $\overline{D}\subseteq\overline{U}$.
  So $x = \partial\gamma^* + z$ is a relative boundary in $C_0(\overline{V}, \overline{U})$, thus $\ell[x] = \ell[z]$ in $\hom_0(\overline{V}, \overline{L})$.
  However, because $B$ surrounds $D$, $[x]\neq [y]$ in $\hom_0(\overline{B}, \overline{D})$ contradicting our assumption that $\ell$ is injective.

% In the following let $X$ be a topological space and $\overline{A} := X\setminus U$ denote the complement of a subset $U$ of $X$.
