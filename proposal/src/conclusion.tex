Much of the work on unifying the TCC and SFA has already been completed.
Theorems that generalize the TCC to topologically representative samples for bounding subspaces as well as the stability of relative persistence diagrams have been proved independently.
However, proper use of duality is required in order to identify their assumptions in a unified theorem.
Properly stating this theorem requires a more nuanced understanding of duality for manifolds.
Some insight may be provided by additional work on images of Lipschitz extensions that requires constructing the duality isomorphism explicitly.
