I will adapt the TCC as a way to provide verified scalar field analysis.
This is to develop a theoretical foundation for how topological methods can be used to \emph{verify} data with respect to prior information about the topology of the underlying space.
This work will re-cast the TCC as a way to check that a sample is \emph{topologically representative} of the underlying space with assumptions that are more natural to samples of functions.
I will also show how a generalization of these assumptions can be used to prove stability results of the resulting persistence diagram.
This gives a bound on the quality of the approximation that is proportional to the resolution of the sample.

Additional work is motivated by an application involving Lipschitz extensions that requires computing \emph{topological duals} within the persistence computation.
I will extend the existing theory of persistent (co)homology to support duality via the cap product with a fundamental class.
I will then modify the standard reduction algorithm for persistent (co)homology to pair (co)cycles with dual (co)boundaries.
As the fundamental class required for computing topological duals is provided by the TCC, this work will establish a pipeline for verified topological data analysis.
