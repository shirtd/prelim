  The topological coverage criterion (TCC) can be used to test whether an underlying space is sufficiently well covered by a given data set.
  Given a sufficently dense sample, topological scalar field analysis (SFA) can give a summary of the shape of a real-valued function on a space.
  The goal of this paper is to put these theories together so that one can test coverage with the TCC and then compute a summary with SFA.
  The challenge is that the TCC requires a well-defined boundary that is not generally available in the SFA settings.
  To overcome this, we show how the scalar field itself can be used to define a boundary that can then be used in the TCC.
  This requires a generalization of the TCC proof and resolves one of the major barriers to wider use of the TCC.
  It also extends SFA methods to a wider class of spaces.
