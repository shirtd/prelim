Let $\dist(x,y) = \| x - y\|$ denote the Euclidean distance between points in $\R^d$.
For $X\subset\R^d$ and $y\in\R^d$ let $\dist_X(y) = \displaystyle\min_{x\in X}\dist(x, y)$ denote the distance from $y$ to the set $X$.
The set of all points within some distance $\e > 0$ of $X$ is the \textbf{(open) $\e$-offset of $X$} and will be denoted
\[ X^\e = \{ y\in\R^d\mid \dist_X(y) < \e\}. \]

A function $f : X\to\R$ is said to be $c$-Lipschitz if, for all $x,y\in X$,
\[ | f(x) - f(y) | \leq c\dist(x, y).\]
For a $c$-Lipschitz function $f : X\to\R$ the \textbf{closed $\e$-sub-level sets} of $f$ are defined for $\e\in\R$ as
\[ X_\e = f^{-1}(-\infty,\e] = \{x\in X\mid f(x) \leq \e\}.\]
Throughout, for $A\subset X$ the closed $\e$-sublevel set of $f$ restricted to $A$ will be denoted $A_\e = X_\e \cap A$.
